# donut.cpp
Inspired by [Jonas tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI) and made with the help of [Donut-math](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).
The math has been laid out, implemented and coded. Everything should be correct. Ofcourse, it's *very* slow (because of matrix multiplications) so no animation as such. Tried extending rotating donut to any 3d shape but got lost in values and how to fit it in screen.
